# Sri Balaji Ladies Tailoring & Coaching Website

## 🧵 Project Overview & Inspiration

This project is a tribute to my mother—a fierce, independent woman and the **driving force behind** **Sri Balaji Ladies Tailoring & Coaching** in Tharagampatti, Karur.

As the **sole earning member** of our family, she has faced immense struggles, working tirelessly for years with limited income to support us. Despite the financial hardships and the demanding nature of her work, her spirit remains unbroken. This website is my small contribution to her journey—using my skills as a developer to give her hard work the visibility it truly deserves.

My goal is to transform her local shop into a recognized brand, helping her showcase her intricate designs to a wider audience and grow her training institute, so her dedication finally receives the reward it merits.
